**1. Personalized Diet Overview**

Madhu is a 40-year-old vegetarian woman from Kochi, Kerala, currently in her menstrual phase and aiming for weight loss.  Her current diet lacks variety and nutritional balance.  We will focus on incorporating Kerala's rich culinary heritage with a focus on iron replenishment (due to menstruation) and weight management, while keeping preparation time manageable. We will prioritize quick and medium recipes to fit her 2-hour cooking time constraint.

**Location-based suggestions:** We'll heavily utilize Kerala staples like Matta rice (in moderation), coconut, turmeric, black pepper, drumstick, ash gourd, moringa leaves, and red cow peas.

**Health condition considerations:** Since Madhu reports no specific health conditions beyond menstrual pain, we'll focus on a balanced diet to support overall health and manage discomfort through anti-inflammatory foods.

**Phase-specific recommendations:** During her menstrual phase, the diet will emphasize iron-rich foods, anti-inflammatory ingredients (turmeric, ginger), and easily digestible options.
