**1. Personalized Diet Overview**

Pratistha, a 21-year-old woman from Kochi, Kerala, experiencing PMS symptoms (pain and mood swings) during her luteal phase, with existing B12 and iron deficiencies, requires a diet plan focusing on iron and B12 replenishment, PMS symptom management, and weight management (targeting a 3kg weight loss).  Given her location, we'll leverage the nutritional richness of Kerala cuisine and incorporate easily accessible ingredients.  We'll focus on quick recipes due to her limited cooking time (2 hours).

**Location-based suggestions:** We will utilize Kerala staples like Matta rice, coconut, turmeric, and black pepper.  We will incorporate local vegetables like drumstick, ash gourd, and moringa leaves.  Traditional dishes like Avial and Thoran will be adapted for quicker preparation.

**Health condition considerations:**  The plan addresses PMS symptoms through magnesium-rich foods (leafy greens, millets), omega-3s (fish â€“ considering her non-vegetarian preference), and complex carbohydrates.  It also focuses on iron and B12 replenishment using readily available sources in Kerala.  Weight management will be achieved through portion control and inclusion of fiber-rich foods to promote satiety.

**Phase-specific recommendations:** During the luteal phase, the emphasis will be on magnesium, complex carbohydrates, and foods that support mood stability.
