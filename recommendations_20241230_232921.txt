**1. Personalized Diet Overview**

* **Location-based suggestions:**  Given Pratistha lives in Kochi, Kerala, the diet plan will heavily utilize Kerala's abundant fresh produce and traditional cooking methods.  We'll incorporate staples like Matta rice, coconut, and spices like turmeric and black pepper, along with local vegetables like drumstick, ash gourd, and moringa leaves.  We will focus on recipes that are easy to prepare on an induction stove.

* **Health condition considerations:** Pratistha is experiencing PMS symptoms (pain and mood swings) and has deficiencies in Iron and B12.  The plan addresses these by incorporating magnesium-rich foods, omega-3 fatty acids (where possible in vegetarian options), complex carbohydrates, and iron-rich foods along with foods that enhance B12 absorption.  We will also focus on reducing inflammation.

* **Phase-specific recommendations:**  Since she's in her luteal phase (days 16-28), the focus is on managing PMS symptoms through magnesium-rich foods, complex carbs, and foods to boost mood and reduce inflammation.
