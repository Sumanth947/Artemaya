**1. Personalized Diet Overview**

Pratistha, a 21-year-old from Kochi, Kerala, experiencing PMS symptoms (pain and mood swings) during her luteal phase and deficiencies in B12 and iron, needs a diet plan focusing on managing PMS, boosting iron and B12 levels, and incorporating Kerala's rich culinary heritage.  Her moderate activity level and preference for fresh, home-cooked meals will be considered.  The plan will incorporate readily available Kerala ingredients and recipes appropriate for her cooking time constraints.

**Location-based suggestions:** We will utilize Kerala's abundant produce, focusing on staples like matta rice, coconut, turmeric, and black pepper.  Local vegetables like drumstick, ash gourd, and elephant yam will be incorporated, along with greens such as moringa leaves and spinach.  Traditional dishes like Avial and Thoran will be adapted for her needs.

**Health condition considerations:**  The plan will emphasize magnesium-rich foods (leafy greens, millets), complex carbohydrates (matta rice, millets), and foods rich in iron and B12 (meat, leafy greens, and potentially supplements as advised by a doctor).  Anti-inflammatory foods like turmeric and ginger will be included to manage PMS symptoms.  Refined foods, excessive caffeine, and salt will be limited.

**Phase-specific recommendations:**  As she's in her luteal phase, the focus will be on managing PMS symptoms with magnesium-rich foods and complex carbohydrates.  Iron and B12 rich foods will be prioritized to address her deficiencies.
